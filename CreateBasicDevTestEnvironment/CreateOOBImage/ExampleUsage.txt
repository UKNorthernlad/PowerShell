baseresourcegroup - This is the name of the resource group that holds your base VNet and StorageAccount.
storageAccountName - This needs to be set the same as the StorageAccount created in the base resource group.
virtualNetworkName - This needs to be set the same as the VirtualNetwork created in the base resource group.
publisher, offer, sku - These together represent the VM you wish to build. See baseimagenames.txt for more info.

virtualMachineSize - Size of the VM in standard Azure unit sizes, e.g. Standard_A4
adminUsername & adminPassword - Any username except "admin". Password must be longer than 8 chars and must meet complexity requirements. Come on, you know what those are, password123 won't cut it!

Add-AzureRMAccount
.\CreateOOBImage.ps1 -ResourceGroupName Servers -ResourceGroupLocation "WestEurope"
